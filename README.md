# 3DEngine
Just learning about 3d graphics, feel free to have a look. It's not very fast but hey ho.

I thought the maths looked cool so I gave it a go.

I followed the videos made by javidx9 (i.e. One Lone Coder) in his Code-It yourself series, the link to the first video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih20l3pJoeU&ab_channel=javidx9

I wanted this to work on Windows, Mac, and Linux so instead of using the console engine that he uses in the video I instead opted for using SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer). 
This comes with a little more setup especially if you're on Windows using Visual Studio but it should only take a few minutes if you follow the instructions on the website:

You can find the latest version of SDL on its website:

If you're interested in doing something similar I cannot recommend javidx9's videos enough, they are fantastic.
